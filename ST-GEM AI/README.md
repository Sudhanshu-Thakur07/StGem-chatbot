## Project Structure

```
st-gem-ai/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css           # Styling and animations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # JavaScript logic and API integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure and semantics
- **CSS3** - Styling, gradients, and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Logic and API integration
- **OpenRouter API** - AI model access
- **LocalStorage** - Chat history persistence

## Configuration

The chatbot uses the OpenRouter API. The API key is configured in `script.js`:

```javascript
const API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here';
const API_URL = 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions';
```

**Note:** For production use, consider implementing proper API key management and security measures.

- Can be cleared using the "Clear Chat" button

### Responsive Design
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly interface

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the gradient colors in `style.css`:
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

### Changing AI Model
Modify the model in `script.js`:
```javascript
model: 'openai/gpt-3.5-turbo'
```

### Adjusting Response Length
Change `max_tokens` in the API request:
```javascript
max_tokens: 1000
```

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This is a basic implementation for project purposes. For production use:

1. Never expose API keys in client-side code
2. Implement backend API proxy
3. Add rate limiting
4. Implement user authentication
5. Sanitize user inputs
6. Add HTTPS enforcement
